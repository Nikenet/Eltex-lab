 * @short_description: Mount management
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see also: GVolume, GUnixMount
 *
 * The #GMount interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when 
 * porting from GnomeVFS, #GMount is the moral equivalent of #GnomeVFSVolume.
 *
 * #GMount is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in
 * quotes because it's not the same as a unix mount, it might be a gvfs
 * mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. Might or
 * might not be related to a volume object.
 * 
 * Unmounting a #GMount instance is an asynchronous operation. For
 * more information about asynchronous operations, see #GAsyncReady
 * and #GSimpleAsyncReady. To unmount a #GMount instance, first call
 * g_mount_unmount() with (at least) the #GMount instance and a
 * #GAsyncReadyCallback.  The callback will be fired when the
 * operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
 * #GAsyncReady structure will be passed to the callback.  That
 * callback should then call g_mount_unmount_finish() with the #GMount
 * and the #GAsyncReady data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully.  If an @error is present when g_mount_unmount_finish() 
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.
